# Welcome to a simple meditation app ðŸ‘‹

Delivering seamless user experience, built with React Native, this simple meditation app features clean design utilizing FlatLists, Linear Gradients, modals, tab bars, icons, and file-based routing through Expo Router.

## Motivation

As a way to keep practicing software development and a small way to get my toes wet into coding a project using React Native, I decided to tackle this meditation app all while picking up a Controls Engineering contract for the last half of 2024. Shout out to [stevenGarciaDev](https://github.com/stevenGarciaDev/simple-meditation-app-expo-react-native) who's tutorial I followed to help build this app. Following the completion of this project, I plan on developing a workout app that helps keep track of workout out times and progress specific for the functional fitness community.

## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo
- NativeWind
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

## Features

âœµ **Welcome Screen**: Welcome screen to help users get started with the app.

âœµ **Meditation List Scree**: A flat list displays previews of various meditations with corresponding images.
